# CSC7052-Easyjet-DBMS
Relational database project recreating Easyjet.com flight booking system.

The overall aim of this project was to design and implement a relational database management system in phpMyAdmin formulated on selected aspects of a real commercial airlineâ€™s booking system, EasyJet.com. The key functionality of the database is to emulate the account creation, point-of-sale, and flight booking management systems found at EasyJet.com. Primarily, the database should facilitate the accurate handling of data and the secure storage of sensitive information. 

Certain aspects of the booking process such as car hire and accommodation were determined to be out of scope for the project due to their reliance on third-party data structures and/or APIs.
